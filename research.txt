#THEME BACKGROUND:

In addition to size and scope, OT networks involve myriad types of devices connecting to
their networks. Signature-based cybersecurity solutions are unlikely to deliver the requisite performance
to detect new attack vectors (zero-day exploits). Artificial Intelligence can help discover devices and
hidden patterns while processing large amounts of data. Machine Learning can help monitor incoming and
outgoing traffic for any deviations in behaviour in the OT ecosystem. If a threat or anomaly is
detected, alarms are to be sent to security admins warning them about the suspicious traffic.
AI and ML can be used to build lightweight endpoint detection technologies. This can be an indispensable
solution, especially in situations where OT devices lack the processing power and need behavior-based
detection capabilities that aren't as resource intensive. Problem Statement ÔÇ£Build AI based tool
to help discover devices and hidden patterns while processing large amounts of real-time pipeline
operational data (Industrial protocols such as DNP 3.0, Modbus, IEC 101). The tool should help in
monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic for any deviations in behaviour in the OT ecosystem.
If threat or anomaly is detected, alarms should be sent to security admin warning them about the
suspicious traffic. The tool should also suggest corrective actions/steps to be taken in order to
thwart or minimize the attackÔÇÖs intensity and damage to the OT systems.
Further, the tool should have in-built dashboard facility to display logs/reports to help the
admin in carrying out diagnosis.

DNP3 Protocol
protocal is a language in which computer systems talk with each other.
DNP3 is one such protocal

Master stations will be able to pull information form other devicies and put it on a screen.
